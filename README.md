# wave-function-collapse
This is still a work in progress. You can go to the github ethantomb.github.io/wave-function-collapse if you want to play with it.
I made the tileset myself and the cars are beautiful and you won't convince me otherwise. Just don't look at them too closely.
To Do:
1) Fix ugly textures -Done
2) Add CSS to site, make it prettier
3) Give user ability to chose 1 or multiple starting tiles before generating.
